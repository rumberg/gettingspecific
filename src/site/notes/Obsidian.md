# Obsidian
A second brain for [[Mac|Mac]] and by far my favorite tool.

![Obsidian is so flexible, that you can use it as a hyper-focused writing tool.](https://i.imgur.com/FuXeheF.png)

Obsidian got so good in recent months that it is now packed with *thousands of plugins* that make creating, curating, rediscovering, sorting, and learning content a breeze.

![Or you can use it with a ridiculous amount of addons and features](https://i.imgur.com/PvDaQbv.png)

It has a thriving [community on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/veuWUTm).
